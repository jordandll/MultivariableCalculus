## Vector Fields and Line Integrals

A vector field attaches a vector to each point. For example, the sun has a gravitational field, which gives its gravitational attraction at each point in space. The field does work as it moves a mass along a curve. We will learn to express this work as a line integral and to compute its value.

In physics, some force fields conserve energy. Such conservative fields are determined by their potential energy functions. We will define what a conservative field is mathematically and learn to identify them and find their potential function.
