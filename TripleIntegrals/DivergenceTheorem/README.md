# Triple Integrals
## Part B: 
### Flux and the Divergence Theorem
Here we will extend Green’s theorem in flux form to the divergence (or Gauss’) theorem relating the flux of a vector field through a closed surface to a triple integral over the region it encloses. Before learning this theorem we will have to discuss the surface integrals, flux through a surface and the divergence of a vector field.
