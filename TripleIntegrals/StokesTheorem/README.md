# Part C: 
### Line Integrals and Stokes' Theorem

In this part we will extend Green’s theorem in work form to Stokes’ theorem. For a given vector field, this relates the field’s work integral over a closed space curve with the flux integral of the field’s curl over any surface that has that curve as its boundary.
