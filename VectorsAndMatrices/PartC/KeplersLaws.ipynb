    "# Kepler's Second Law\n",
    "\n",
    "By studying the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe’s data about the motion of the planets,\n",
    "Kepler formulated three empirical laws; two of them can be stated as follows:  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Second Law**:  A planet moves in a plane, and the radius vector (from the sun to the\n",
    "planet) sweeps out equal areas in equal times.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**First Law**:  The planet’s orbit in that plane is an ellipse, with the sun at one focus.  \n",
    "\n",
    "From these laws, Newton deduced that the force keeping the planets in their orbits had\n",
    "magnitude $1/d^2$, where $d$ was the distance to the sun; moreover, it was directed toward the\n",
    "sun, or as was said, *central*, since the sun was placed at the origin.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Using a little vector analysis (without coordinates), this section is devoted to showing\n",
    "that the Second Law is equivalent to the force being central.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It is harder to show that an elliptical orbit implies the magnitude of the force\n",
    "is of the form $K/d^2$, and vice-versa; this uses vector analysis in polar coordinates\n",
    "and requires the solution of non-linear differential equations."
